Twitter Search
===============

This is a simple example on how to use twitter search API to retrieve tweets.

First you need to create an application at [twitter's dev site](https://apps.twitter.com/)

Then get the generated **API Key** and **API Secret** and make then available in your `ENV` as
`ENV['twitter_config_key']` and `ENV['twitter_config_secret']`

You can user your .rvmrc file to do this  
`export twitter_config_key=xxxxxxxxx`  
`export twitter_config_secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Now, start rails server and enjoy! :)
